# Hush

An ambient soundboard designed to help users relax with a mixture of relaxing sound loops. There are six sound cards: birdsong, rainfall, coffee ambience, park ambience, campfire, and thunderstorm. The volumes of each individual card can be customised for personal preference. A live version of this app can be found at: https://aadam-gafar.github.io/Hush/. It is sourced from a separate branch.

To build your own version, clone the repository and ensure the following settings are enabled in your branch:
- In angular.json, set "outputPath" to "docs"
- In package.json, set "private" to "false"
- In index.json, set "base href" to "/Hush"

Then run `ng build` in the terminal.
